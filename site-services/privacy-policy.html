<h2>1. PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT FROM YOU</h2>

<p>When you engage with us, (e.g. sending us emails, contacting us via telephone, or visiting or making an enquiry through The Website), you may provide Personal Information about yourself including your name and contact details, (e.g. your address, email address, and telephone number). If you are using our services, you may also provide us with your financial information and various other necessary Personal Information. Where you make use of the Website we may also collect information about your use of the Website, (e.g. your IP address and choice of web browser). Some of this Personal Information is collected and processed so we can perform a contract with you, some for the purpose of compliance with applicable legislation, and some for the purposes of our legitimate business interests, (namely to carry out and improve our business, analyse the use of the Website and services and support our staff and clients).</p>
<p>In order to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, we record calls made on certain employees' landlines and mobile telephone lines.</p>
<p>Where you apply for a job with us, we may collect from you and third parties, (where relevant,) additional Personal Information such as your CV and any references. Unless you agree that we can keep such information on file for future opportunities or we need to retain such information for compliance with our legal obligations, in the event that you are unsuccessful, we will only retain this Personal Information for as long as is reasonably necessary to process your application.</p>
<p>Where you provide Personal Information on behalf of another individual, you are responsible for notifying that individual that you have provided their Personal Information to us and directing them to this Policy so they can see how we will process their Personal Information.</p>

<h2>2. PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER SOURCES</h2>

<p>We may receive information from third parties who collect Personal Information from you and pass it on to us. For example: (i) in connection with services that we provide to our clients; and (ii) we may receive information from past employers and others concerning your employment history where you apply for a job with us. Where this is the case the third party is responsible for informing you that they have shared your Personal Information with us, directing you to this Policy and obtaining any relevant consents from you to ensure you are happy with the ways in which your Personal Information will be used. However, once we are holding it, we will only handle any person's Personal Information in accordance with this Policy.</p>
<h2>3. SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

<p>&quot;<strong>Sensitive Personal Information</strong>&quot; is Personal Information concerning an individual's: (i) racial or ethnic origin, (ii) political opinions, (iii) religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature, (iv) membership of a trade union, (v) physical or mental health or condition, (vi) sexual life or orientation, (vii) commission or alleged commission of any offence or any proceedings for any offence committed or alleged to have been committed by him/her, the disposal of such proceedings, or the sentence of any court in such proceedings.</p>
<p>Where we receive Sensitive Personal Information, we will only keep such information for as long as strictly necessary in order to comply with our obligations under the law.</p>
<h2>4. WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We will only use your Personal Information in order to: (a) provide you with our services on an ongoing basis, in accordance with our contract, (b) improve our Website and services, (c) comply with our own legal and regulatory obligations, including in relation to financial promotion, applicable anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financial legislation (d) for our internal business processes, including providing support to our staff, and (e) where relevant, process your application for employment.</p>
<p>Where you have explicitly consented at the time we collected your Personal Information or where we otherwise have a right to do so, we may also use your Personal Information to let you know about any of our services that may be of interest to you and/or inform you about important changes or developments to our services by email.</p>
<p>Where you or your employer (or any other entity you work for) provides services to us, you and/or they may provide us with some of your Personal Information in connection with the provision of the services, such as your name, business contact details, and other Personal Information. We will only process such Personal Information in connection with the provision of the services, (such as using your contact details to discuss the services,) and in accordance with this Policy. In addition, where necessary, we may also share your Personal Information with third parties in order to provide our services.</p>
<p>If you change your mind about us using your Personal Information in the ways described in this Policy, please let us know by contacting the Chairman of the data privacy forum at <a href="mailto:GDPRqueries@tpicap.com">GDPRqueries@tpicap.com </a>. You may also opt out of receiving marketing emails from us by following the instructions outlined in the email.</p>
<h2>5. HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

<p>Where it is necessary for the performance of our contract with you or for our internal business processes, we may share your Personal Information with certain third parties, professional advisors, service providers, regulatory bodies, auditors, technology providers, and any duly authorised agents or related, associated, or affiliated companies of the foregoing for the same purposes.</p>
<p>By submitting your Personal Information to us, you acknowledge that such third parties may receive and process your Personal Information. We ask all third parties to treat your Personal Information securely and in accordance with this Policy and will take reasonable steps to enforce this.</p>
<p>In addition, it may be necessary to disclose your Personal Information if we are under a duty to disclose your Personal Information in order to comply with any legal obligation, (such as anti-money laundering or anti-terrorist financing obligations), carry out an internal investigation, enforce our Terms and Conditions on our Website and any other agreement, or protect the rights, property, or safety, of our companies and our clients, directors, employees, or other personnel. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and prevention. They in turn may exchange information (including Personal Information and financial information) with foreign tax authorities.</p>
<p>In exceptional circumstances, if we are sold or merged with another company we may disclose your information to a potential buyer, including your Personal Information and other information concerning your relationship with us, so that they can continue to provide the services you have requested.</p>
<h2>6. OUR SECURITY MEASURES AND INFORMATION ABOUT WHEN WE DELETE DATA</h2>

<p>We will only keep your Personal Information for as long as we reasonably require and, in any event, only for as long as the Data Protection Legislation allows.</p>
<p>Where you have chosen a password which allows you to access certain parts of the Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We advise you not to share your password with anyone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and, although we will take steps to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information when transmitted via the Website; any transmission is therefore at your own risk.</p>
<p>Some of our premises use CCTV, however, this is under the control of third parties and therefore you should consult any notices they display and their privacy statements for more information.</p>
<h2>7. TRANSFERRING PERSONAL INFORMATION OUTSIDE OF THE EEA</h2>

<p>Any Personal Information provided to us may be transferred to and stored on third parties&rsquo; servers. We take steps to protect your Personal Information from unauthorised access and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, and damage.</p>
<p>In processing your Personal Information, it will sometimes be necessary for us to transfer your Personal Information outside the European Economic Area (&quot;<strong>EEA</strong>&quot;) to our staff and our third-party service providers. It may also be accessed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us, or for one of our suppliers or group companies. This includes people engaged in, among other things, the provision of support services to us. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy and the Data Protection Legislation when it is processed in, or otherwise accessed from, a location outside the EEA. This means that we will only transfer your Personal Information to our non-European offices and Funds, and to third parties based outside the EEA if that party: (a) is situated in a country that has been confirmed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection to Personal Information, (b) has agreed (by way of written contract incorporating the &quot;model clauses&quot; as approved by the European Commission or by some other form of data transfer mechanism approved by the European Commission) to provide all protections to your Personal Information as required by the Data Protection Legislation, or (c) we have your explicit consent to do so (such as where you have requested a service from one of our Funds situated outside the EEA). Where any transfer takes place under a written contract, you have the right to request a copy of that contract and may do so by contacting the Chairman of the Privacy Forum at <a href="mailto:GDPRqueries@tpicap.com">GDPRqueries@tpicap.com. </a>For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the UK is no longer a part of the EEA, references in this paragraph to the EEA shall mean the EEA and the UK.</p>
<p>By submitting your Personal Information to us, you acknowledge this transferring, storing, or processing of your Personal Information.</p>
<h2>8. ACCESSING AND UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

<p>You have the right to ask us not to process your Personal Information for marketing or research purposes. If you have given us your express consent, or where we otherwise have the right to do so, we may use your Personal Information for marketing purposes. If we intend to disclose your Personal Information to any third party for marketing purposes, we will seek your explicit consent prior to any such transfer. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your Personal Information.</p>
<p>You are entitled to know details about the Personal Information we hold about you and how that information is processed. If you would like to request this, please contact the Chairman of the Privacy Forum at <a href="mailto:GDPRqueries@tpicap.com">GDPRqueries@tpicap.com </a>and we will provide you with the information to which you are entitled.</p>
<p>You can also ask us to: (a) make any changes to ensure that any Personal Information we hold about you is accurate and up to date; (b) erase or stop processing any Personal Information we hold about you where there is no longer a legal ground for us to hold it; or (c) in some circumstances, transfer any information we hold about you to a specified third party. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at Chairman of the Privacy Forum at <a href="mailto:GDPRqueries@tpicap.com">GDPRqueries@tpicap.com.</a></p>
<h2>9. COMPLAINTS</h2>

<p>Should you have any queries or complaints in relation to how we use your Personal Information, please contact the Chairman of the Privacy Forum at <a href="mailto:GDPRqueries@tpicap.com">GDPRqueries@tpicap.com </a>should you wish to take any complaints or queries further, you have the right to contact the Information Commissioner's Office regarding such issues.</p>

<!--

<p>This is the policy (“Privacy Policy”) of ICAP Management Services Limited and its affiliates ("ICAP") regarding the privacy of information that ICAP may collect on this website (the "Site"). This Privacy Policy only applies to the information that ICAP collects on the Site and does not apply to information ICAP collects by any other method.</p>

<h2>Collection of Information</h2>
<p>When you register to use the Site or choose to submit information to the Site, ICAP may collect information from you such as your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, your firm’s name or comments. Generally, the information ICAP collects on the Site is used only for ICAP’s own internal purposes, for example, to improve the content of the Site, to improve ICAP’s marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyse Site usage patterns on an aggregate basis, to improve ICAP content and Site offerings, and may be used by ICAP to contact you to provide you with information ICAP believes may be useful to you. ICAP believes that these uses allow it to improve the Site and better tailor it to meet users' needs.</p>

<h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
<p>At no time will ICAP sell or broker any of the information that ICAP receives from you through your use of the Site to any third parties. As a general rule, ICAP will not disclose any personal information to any third parties, except in the following circumstances: (i) when ICAP believes in good faith that it is required under applicable law, (ii) to protect other users of the Site, or (iii) to respond to an emergency and as set forth below. The recipients of such information may include companies or individuals that are established in countries outside of the European Economic Area and which may not have comprehensive data protection laws.</p>
<p>Information may be given to third-party contractors or other persons or entities that ICAP engages in the course of outsourcing certain functions. Information will be shared with such third-party contractors, persons or entities only to the extent reasonably necessary for them to perform services on ICAP’s behalf and not for any other purpose, and pursuant to reasonable confidentiality obligations. ICAP may disclose information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or regulatory authority or if ICAP believes in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with legal requirements or process, prevent a crime or protect national security. If you engage, or ICAP reasonably suspects that you are engaging, in any illegal activity, ICAP may disclose your personal information without a subpoena, warrant or other court order to the extent ICAP determines in its sole discretion is necessary to cooperate with appropriate authorities. ICAP reserves the right to transfer any information that ICAP has collected about you through your use of the Site to a third party that acquires a portion of ICAP’s business or in the event that ICAP sells or otherwise transfers some or all of its assets related to the Site.</p>
<p>ICAP maintains rigorous physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect personal information against unauthorised access or disclosure, accidental loss, use, alteration or destruction. ICAP is aware of, and complies with, relevant laws and regulations regarding personal data.</p>

<h2>Access and Correction</h2>
<p>Under the laws of some jurisdictions, you may have the right to request access to your personal information and to request correction of it, if it is incorrect. If, at any time, you do not wish for ICAP to contact you using the information that ICAP has collected, or you wish to review, update or delete your personal information or you have any questions concerning our Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact ICAP by post using the following address: Legal and Compliance Department, ICAP, 2 Broadgate, London, EC2M 7UR.</p>

<h2>Other Websites</h2>
<p>The Site may contain links to third-party websites over which ICAP has no control. ICAP is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of such other websites and ICAP encourages you to review the privacy policies, if any, on such websites.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>ICAP may place a small text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain personal information, although it will enable the Site to relate your use of the Site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided to the Site (such as username) and to track your use of the Site. Tracking information is used to create information on user demographics and Site traffic patterns on an aggregate basis and is not connected to the identities or other personal information of individual users.</p>
<p>ICAP reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, in its sole discretion, by updating this web page. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
